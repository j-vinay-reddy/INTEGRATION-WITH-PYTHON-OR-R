üìä Power BI Dashboard ‚Äì Panel Pricing & Cluster Analysis Overview
üîç Project Summary
This Power BI dashboard presents an interactive analysis of solar panel pricing and cluster-based grouping for enhanced business insights. It is designed to help users identify pricing trends, understand group behavior, and make data-driven decisions regarding panel pricing and distribution strategies.

The dashboard brings together multiple advanced visualization tools, including decision trees, scatter plots, and bar charts, all laid out in a clean, vibrant interface. It‚Äôs especially useful for analysts, pricing strategists, and product managers who want a deeper understanding of how solar panel prices vary by features, clusters, and market behavior.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Dashboard Elements
The dashboard contains the following major components:

üß† 1. Decision Tree (Top Left)
A decision tree visualization analyzes how different attributes impact panel pricing or cluster formation.

Each node splits based on a feature such as panel type, brand, size, or wattage.

It enables users to trace how panels are classified, providing predictive insights into price or category outcomes.

Great for classification analysis, showing the logic behind grouping similar panel types together.

üìà 2. Total Panels by Cluster (Top Right)
A scatter plot is used to show panel distribution across different clusters.

Each dot represents a solar panel, and clusters are color-coded for clarity.

Clustering is likely done using machine learning algorithms (e.g., K-means or hierarchical clustering), grouping panels based on features like efficiency, wattage, or price.

This visualization is essential to uncover similar behavior patterns or characteristics in the panel data.

Users can visually identify which clusters are dense, diverse, or contain outliers.

üìä 3. Total Panels by Price (Bottom Right)
A colorful bar chart illustrates how many panels fall into different price ranges.

It highlights the distribution of panels by cost, helping stakeholders identify popular or rare price points.

This is useful for spotting trends in pricing and deciding optimal price brackets for promotions or discounts.

üéØ 4. Total Panels by Price (Bubble Scatter ‚Äì Bottom Left)
Another scatter plot‚Äîthis time visualized with colored bubbles‚Äîdisplays panels by price while incorporating a third dimension such as wattage, rating, or cluster.

Each bubble represents a panel or category, color-coded to indicate cluster or another attribute.

A quick way to spot patterns and anomalies within specific price points.

Overlapping or densely grouped bubbles may indicate market saturation or competitive pricing.

üìå Side Panel: Summary Stats
Located on the left side of the dashboard, this panel gives a quick snapshot of:

Total Panels: 8,284 panels analyzed in the dataset.

Average Panels per Category: 16.44 (a representation of evenness or imbalance in category distribution).

Average Price: ¬£5.22 per panel ‚Äì helpful as a benchmark.

Price Change Gauge: A circular gauge meter displays the % price change ‚Äì ideal for visualizing short-term or long-term pricing shifts.

üß© Filters & Fields Panel (Right Sidebar)
The filter pane allows users to slice data by cluster, price range, wattage, manufacturer, or other custom parameters.

This enables personalized and interactive exploration of the data.

The fields pane shows the data model, with calculated measures and dimensions that power the visuals.

üíº Use Cases
This dashboard has practical applications in:

Product Strategy: Understand how panel types are priced and clustered.

Pricing Optimization: Identify under- or over-priced segments for re-evaluation.

Market Research: Analyze the distribution and density of products to inform marketing campaigns.

Inventory Management: Recognize high-volume or niche categories to optimize stock.

üì¶ Technologies Used
Power BI Desktop

DAX for calculated measures (e.g., average price, price change)

Power Query for data transformation

Clustering Algorithms (external ML or Power BI built-in)

Interactive filtering and dynamic visual linking

üß† Conclusion
This Power BI dashboard successfully combines data science techniques like clustering and classification with powerful visualization tools to offer a deep, actionable look into panel pricing dynamics. It transforms raw data into meaningful insights, allowing users to explore trends, patterns, and pricing strategies interactively. With its user-friendly design and color-coded clarity, it empowers both technical and non-technical users to make smarter, faster business decisions.
